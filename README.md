# TicTacToe
Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe implementation! 
This project is actually a proof of concept for future projects with the simplest game I could possibly use. With that being said, if it's any use to people attempting to do some client/socket round based games with OOP design it's here for anyone to use. 

To use this, run 
```
python server.py
```
in one terminal, and

```
python client.py
```
in two other terminals. Then play with one player using one terminal.
