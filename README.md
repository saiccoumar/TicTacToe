# Tic Tac Toe
Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe implementation! 
This project is actually a proof of concept for future projects with the simplest game I could possibly use. The idea is that AI Clients can be easily implemented and participate in the game like player clients; I might revisit this with AI later, but I only made this to clear up the client/socket logic with a simple game, and will be tailoring this for another project with more complicated rules. With that being said, if it's any use to people attempting to do some client/socket round based games with OOP design it's here for anyone to use. 

To use this, run 
```
python server.py
```
in one terminal, and

```
python client.py
```
in two other terminals. Then play with one player using one terminal.  

Alternatively,
```
python rng_client.py
```
can be run to use an automated bot that randomly picks an available option instead of multiple players with human inputs.
